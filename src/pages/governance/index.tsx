Each node represents a forum user who has published BIP-related posts, with node size proportional to the user's degree centrality, indicating the number of interactions (comments) they have received or made. Edges represent direct interactions between users through comments on BIP-related discussions. The top 3 most active users by degree are sipredrica (1,180), achow101 (862), and theymos (518). Remarkably, the top 10 users account for 25% of all comments in the BIP discussion network, where a small core of highly engaged participants drives most of the discussion activity. This reflects the concentrated nature of engagement in Bitcoin off-chain governance discussions.</>
